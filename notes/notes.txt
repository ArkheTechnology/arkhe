USE RIGHT HANDED COORDINATE SYSTEM
USE COLUMN-MAJOR MATRICES

2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 MATRICES HAVE BEEN IMPLMENTED BY DERIVING
FROM TMATRIXMM, WHICH IS OBVIOULSY NOT GREAT FOR PERFORMANCE.

THE REASON I DID THIS IS TO GET WORKING CODE OUT WITH MINIMAL
TESTING. WHEN MORE PERFORMANCE IS REQUIRED IT IS JUST A SIMPLE
MATTER OF REPLACING THESE DERIVED CLASSES WITH CONCRETE
CLASSES WITH THE SAME INTERFACE.

THE SAME APPLIES FOR POINTS, VECTORS AND NORMALS, WHICH ARE
BUILT USING INHERITANCE.
